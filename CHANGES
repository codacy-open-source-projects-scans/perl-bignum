0.66 2022-05-16

 * Fix documentation errors.

 * Add more tests.

 * Remove redunant code.

0.65 2022-04-12

 * Restore the upgrading and downgrading in "bignum", with the exception of
   upgrading from Math::BigFloat to Math::BigRat, which I couldn't make sense
   of. Now, both integer literals and integers (and Infs and NaNs) that are the
   result of a computation become Math::BigInt objects, and both non-integer
   literals and non-integers that are as a result of a computation become
   Math::BigFloat objects. The classes used for literal integers and non-
   integers during compile-time are configurable, as well as the classes used
   for downgrading and upgrading during runtime.

 * Add the "bigfloat" pragma, which converts all numeric literals to
   Math::BigFloat objects. This is consistent with the "bigint" pragma, which
   converts all numeric literals to Math::BigInt objects, and the "bigrat"
   pragma which converts all numeric literals to Math::BigRat objects.

0.64 2021-12-28

 * Fix CPAN RT #140470. The pragmas ignored user-specified backend libraries.
   Add tests to verify the fix.

 * Add missing documentation.

0.63 2021-10-08

 * This version instroduces no changes to the Perl modules, only the tests.

 * Remove tests that don't work on old Perls and that were actually testing
   Math::Big(Int|Float|Rat) more than big(int|num|rat).

 * Skip tests that don't work on older versions of Perl.

 * Remove Perl v5.10.0 as dependency. This distribution is compatible with Perls
   back to at least v5.6.1, although some functionality (e.g., nesting the
   pragmas) requires more recent versions of Perl.

0.62 2021-10-03

 * Add support for multiple options in import(), so that one can use, e.g.,

    use bignum accuracy => 20, lib => "GMP";

 * Make sure the bigrat pragma always returns Math::BigRat objects.

 * Make the "trace" option work as indended, or at least according to what I
   believe is the intention.

 * Improve documentation. Fix typos, improve wording, add more examples etc.

0.61 2021-10-01

 * Improve documentation related to floating point literals.

 * Skip tests that fail due to Perl's broken handling of floating point literals
   before v5.32.0.

0.60 2021-09-28

 * Separate the bigint, bignum, and bigrat pragmas.

   - The bigint pragma now converts every numeric constant that represents an
     integer to a Math::BigInt object. Non-integers are converted to
     Math::BigInt NaNs. With the previous behaviour, only some numeric constant
     integers were converted to a Math::BigInt.

   - The bignum pragma now converts every numeric constant to a Math::BigFloat
     object.

   - The bigrat pragma now converts every numeric constant to a Math::BigRat
     pragma.

   The pragmas no longer activate upgrading and downgrading. The upgrading and
   downgrading must now be activated explicitly. The rationale behind
   deactivating it by default is that can cause infinite looping where objects
   bounce back and forth between different classes. Explicitly requesting a
   specific class doesn't always work either, because the object might be
   automatically upgraded or downgraded to a different class.

   Only one pragma can be used at a time in a given scope. Enabling one pragma
   disables the others in the same scope.

 * Implementat working version of "no bigint", "no bignum", and "no bigrat".
   Previously, the upgrading and downgrading activated by, e.g., "use bigint"
   was not deactivated by "no bigint".

 * Sync behaviour with the Math-BigInt distribution.

0.53 2021-07-12

 * Sync with the Math-BigInt distribution.

0.52 2021-07-10

 * Updated BUGS and SUPPORT sections in POD (remove dead links, add reference
   to GitHub repo, update the author's e-mail address, etc.).

 * Add tests to verify that Math::BigInt::Lite supports new functionality
   introduced in Math::BigInt.

0.51 2018-10-08

 * Better way to catch warnings (CPAN RT #126900).

 * Better Makefile.PL.

0.50 2018-04-17

 * Fix t/option_l.t to match changes in Math::BigInt.

 * The tests now require Test::More version 0.88 or newer.

 * New MANIFEST.SKIP file based on the template in the ExtUtils-Manifest
   distribution.

 * Format CHANGES according to CPAN::Changes::Spec.

 * Add test files t/release-test-version.t, t/release-portability.t, and
   t/release-cpan-changes.t.

 * Convert test file t/02pod.t to t/release-pod.t and t/03podcov.t to
   t/release-pod-coverage.t.

0.49 2018-02-03 pjacklam

 * Improve specification of required modules in Makefile.PL.

 * Fix typo in CHANGES file.

0.48 2018-01-31 pjacklam

   make Perl v5.10 the minimum required version.

 * Verify that CPAN RT #102006 is fixed.

0.47 2016-12-13 pjacklam

 * Add more logic to Makefile.PL regarding INSTALLDIRS (CPAN RT #119199
   and #119225).

0.46 2016-12-11 pjacklam

 * Fix Makefile.PL so that this module installs over the core version.

0.45 2016-12-03 pjacklam

 * Use ExtUtils::MakeMaker rather than Module::Install in Makefile.PL

 * Remove INSTALL file. The information is in the README file.

   bigint.pm, and bigrat.pm.

 * Remove unused variables in Math/BigInt/Trace.pm and Math/BigFloat/Trace.pm

 * Update README and BUGS files.

 * Remove code that was accidentally left in t/infnan.inc after debugging.

   distributions.

 * Replace function calls with method calls.

0.42 2016-01-05 pjacklam

 * "use strict" and "use warnings" everywhere.

 * Reformat some if the code according to the "perlstyle" man page. It makes
   the code easier for read, for me at least.

 * Add descriptions to tests.

 * Reorder CHANGES to chronological order.

 * Use bpi() as a class method, not a function.

 * Replace "use vars ..." with "our ...".

 * More descriptive variable names.

 * Start POD sections with =pod

 * Allow "nan", "inf", and "infinity", and ingore case, since core Perl allows
   these. We want to be compatible. Add tests to "infnan.inc".

0.41 2015-09-25 pjacklam

 * hex() and oct() now have the same semantics as the corresponding core
   functions. E.g., hex("cat") returns 202 and a warning "Illegal hexadecimal
   digit 't' ignored at ..." rather than NaN.
